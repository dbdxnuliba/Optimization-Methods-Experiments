Including Steepest Descent Algorithm, Damped Newton Method, Modified Newton Method, SR1, DFP, BFGS, L-BFGS, Broyden and so on.

Also consider these methods using different line search such as exact line search, Wolfe conditions, Armijo conditions and Goldstein conditions.

Besides, use Waston Function and Discrete Boundary Value Function to accomplish the experiments for running time, iterations and calls for gradiant, function and Hessian matrix
